## Synopsis

Forecast data is pulled from forecast.io when the application is launched, and can be refreshed by the user via button click. 
The user can click buttons on the home screen to view the daily or weekly forecasts. After clicking the button, a new activity is launched and the respective data (either daily or weekly forecast) is displayed in a custom ListView. User can click on a list item to display more detailed data for that day or time.

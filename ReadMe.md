## Synopsis

The current forecast is pulled from forecast.io when the application is launched, and can be refreshed by the user. 
The user can click buttons on the home screen to view the daily or weekly forecasts. After clicking the button, a new activity is launched
and the respective data (either daily or weekly forecast) is loaded from forecast.io and displayed in a custom ListView.
